#### [PCOM-GO](https://github.com/BlackBuck/pcom-go) ```Golang```
 - Built a parser combinator library in Go for constructing complex parsers.
 - Implemented core combinators like or, and, Many0, Seq, and Lazy for recursive parsing.
 - Added transformation features with ”Map” and flexible parsing using ”Between” combinators.
 - Conducted rigorous error handling, testing, and optimization for reliability and performance.
#### [AI vs Human Voice Recognizer](https://github.com/BlackBuck/Deepfake-Audio-Recognition) ```Python, PyTorch, Librosa, Numpy```

 - Built a classifier that distinguishes real audio from AI-generated.
 - Extracted MEL Spectrogram from audio and created a balanced dataset.
 - Compared various architectures like AlexNet, MobileNet, and ResNet against a simpler CNN.
 - Achieved a maximum accuracy of 99.7 % using early stopping and 5-fold cross-validation.
#### [Hisaab-Kitaab](https://github.com/BlackBuck/hisaab) ```NextJS, ReactJS, PostgreSQL, NodeJS```
 - Built a daily expense tracker using React, NextJS, and PostgreSQL.
 - Implemented skeleton loading for better loading of UI and improved user experience.
 - Visualized the monthly expenses to improve usability.
#### [Self-learning Platformer Game](https://github.com/BlackBuck/Self-learning-runner/) ```Python, PyGame```
 - Designed and developed a platformer game.
 - Built a fully connected neural network (FCNN) from scratch to train the game to play autonomously.
